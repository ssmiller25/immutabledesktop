Role Name
=========

A role for my development environment.  This is a bit unique - and
DOES NOT container kubernetes development stuff explicitly.  This
will include and IDEs and local environments

Requirements
------------

None

Role Variables
--------------

N/A

Dependencies
------------

None

Example Playbook
----------------

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

    - hosts: localhost
      roles:
         - devenv
